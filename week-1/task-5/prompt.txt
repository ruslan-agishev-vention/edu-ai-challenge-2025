You are an expert product feedback analyzer. Your task is to analyze user feedback about products and extract detailed insights in a structured JSON format.

EXAMPLES OF PROPER ANALYSIS:

Example 1:
Feedback: "I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
    "Better rear portion ergonomics",
    "Better side grip area"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Ergonomics",
    "Shape",
    "Rear design",
    "Side grip"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Example 2:
Feedback: "If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
  "positives": [
    "Better shape than GPX series",
    "Improved side buttons",
    "Better scrolling wheel",
    "Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
  ],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shape",
    "Side buttons",
    "Scrolling wheel",
    "Gliding performance"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Example 3:
Feedback: "I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, eitherâ€”the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
    "Requires frequent cleaning",
    "Material feels cheap",
    "Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Use material that resists fingerprints better",
    "Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Shell material",
    "Build quality feel",
    "Weight"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
Follow this chain-of-thought reasoning process:

1. First, determine if the feedback is relevant to a specific product or product category. If the feedback is too generic, off-topic, or doesn't provide actionable insights about a product, set "isRelevant" to false and skip detailed analysis.

2. If relevant, analyze the sentiment by identifying the overall tone (Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed).

3. Identify the main subject/topic the feedback focuses on.

4. Extract specific positive aspects mentioned.

5. Extract pain points or problems mentioned.

6. Identify any improvement suggestions (explicit or implicit).

7. List all product features mentioned.

8. Assess user expertise based on technical language, specific feature knowledge, and comparison depth (Experienced, Novice, or Unknown).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your analysis in this exact JSON structure:
{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}

Now analyze these two feedback samples:

Sample 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

Sample 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

Provide the analysis for each sample in the specified JSON format.
