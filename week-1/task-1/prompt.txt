**Prompt for Chain-of-Thought Database Selection:**

You are a database architect tasked with selecting the most appropriate database solution for a new application. I want you to use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to analyze the requirements step-by-step and justify your final recommendation.

**Instructions:**
1. Break down each requirement and explain what it means for database selection
2. Consider different database types (relational, NoSQL document, graph, key-value, etc.)
3. Evaluate how each database type handles the specific requirements
4. Provide clear reasoning for eliminating unsuitable options
5. Make a final recommendation with detailed justification

**Application Requirements:**
- Social platform with millions of users
- Need to store user profiles, posts, and connections between users
- High data read speed required
- Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
- Scalability is important as the user base grows

**Please structure your response as follows:**

**Step 1: Requirement Analysis**
Analyze each requirement and explain its implications for database choice.

**Step 2: Database Type Evaluation**
Consider different database types and how they align with each requirement.

**Step 3: Elimination Process**
Explain which database types are less suitable and why.

**Step 4: Final Recommendation**
Select the most appropriate database type with complete justification.

**Step 5: Implementation Considerations**
Mention any additional considerations for the chosen solution.

Think through this methodically, showing your reasoning at each step. Do not jump to conclusions - walk through the logical process of elimination and selection.
