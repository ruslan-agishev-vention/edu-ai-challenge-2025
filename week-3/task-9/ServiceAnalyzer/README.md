## Configuration

### Setting up your OpenAI API Key

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your API key to version control!

Choose one of the following methods to configure your OpenAI API key:

#### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

#### Method 2: appsettings.json (Local development only)
Create an `appsettings.json` file in the project root:
```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your_openai_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

**Note**: Add `appsettings.json` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
