## Summary

A 25-year-old healthy engineering student and part-time postman presents with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain is localized over the heart area, sometimes radiating to the neck, worsens with coughing or lying down, and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu a week ago. There is no history of trauma, chronic medical conditions, medications (aside from occasional Tylenol), allergies, or prior surgeries.

Notably, his father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which contributes to his concern about having a heart attack. He denies smoking, recreational drug use, and drinks alcohol occasionally.

The clinician acknowledges his fears, provides reassurance, and plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function and determine the cause of his pain. The patient is advised not to worry excessively until results are available.
