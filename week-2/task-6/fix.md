# Enigma Machine Bug Fixes

## Problem Summary
The original Enigma machine implementation had critical flaws that prevented correct encryption/decryption reciprocity - encrypted messages could not be properly decrypted back to their original form.

## Bugs Identified

### Bug #1: Missing Final Plugboard Transformation
**Issue**: The plugboard was only applied on input, not output
- Original code applied `plugboardSwap()` once at the beginning of encryption
- Real Enigma machines apply plugboard transformation twice: once on input, once on output

**Fix**: Added second plugboard application in `encryptChar()` method
```javascript
// Apply plugboard swap again on output (critical for correct Enigma behavior)
c = plugboardSwap(c, this.plugboardPairs);
```

### Bug #2: Incorrect Rotor Stepping Logic
**Issue**: Flawed rotor stepping sequence and timing
- Used `else if` logic that prevented proper middle rotor stepping
- Incorrect understanding of when rotors check notch positions vs. when they step

**Fix**: Rewritten `stepRotors()` method with proper sequencing
```javascript
// 1. If middle rotor is at notch, left rotor steps (double-stepping)
if (middleAtNotch) {
  this.rotors[0].step();
}

// 2. If right rotor is at notch OR middle rotor is at notch, middle rotor steps
if (rightAtNotch || middleAtNotch) {
  this.rotors[1].step();
}

// 3. Right rotor always steps
this.rotors[2].step();
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Plugboard Issue**: Misunderstanding of Enigma signal path - the electrical signal travels through plugboard → rotors → reflector → rotors → plugboard
2. **Stepping Issue**: Incorrect implementation of the mechanical stepping mechanism, particularly the complex "double-stepping" behavior

## Verification
Created comprehensive test suite with 12 tests covering:
- Basic encryption/decryption reciprocity
- Plugboard functionality and integration
- Rotor stepping behavior including double-stepping
- Edge cases and long message processing

**Result**: All tests pass (12/12, 100% success rate), confirming correct Enigma behavior.

## Impact
- ✅ Encryption and decryption are now truly reciprocal
- ✅ Plugboard settings work correctly
- ✅ Complex rotor stepping matches historical Enigma behavior
- ✅ Long messages encrypt/decrypt properly
- ✅ All edge cases handled correctly
