GAPS AND LIMITATIONS
===================

Minimal Coverage Areas:

- Performance under extreme loads not tested

Recommendations:
- Add tests for different rotor ordering combinations
- Expand self-encryption verification to full alphabet
- Add benchmark tests for performance characteristics
- Consider adding tests against known historical Enigma test vectors
